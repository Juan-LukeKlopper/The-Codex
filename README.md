# The-Codex
A Collection of Solutions to the World's Most Iconic Coding Challenges  Welcome to "The Codex", a repository of LeetCode solutions written by yours truly. Within these digital halls, you'll find a curated collection of algorithms and data structures implemented in Rust.

## Goals:

- To solidify my grasp of various algorithms and data structures
- To continually challenge myself with new problems

This project is not intended for public contribution or collaboration. It's simply a way for me to learn, experiment, and track my progress in solving LeetCode problems using Rust as the programming language.

If you're interested in learning from these solutions, feel free to browse through them. Otherwise, I'll see you on the next project!
